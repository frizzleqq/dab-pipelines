### Getting started

Sync `uv` environment:
```bash
uv sync
```

# Using this project using the CLI

The Databricks workspace and IDE extensions provide a graphical interface for working
with this project. It's also possible to interact with it directly using the CLI:

1. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

2. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```

3. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

4. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

5. Finally, to run tests locally, use `pytest`:
   ```
   $ uv run pytest
   ```
